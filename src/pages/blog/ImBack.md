This is gonna be a short one -- bringing the blog back, with a full rewrite. Previously it was built using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) plus a [static site generator](https://github.com/Fried-Chicken/ghost-static-site-generator/). 

But I decided I wanted to learn something new, so I built a proof-of-concept using Optimizely CMS and Opti's [Content Graph (GraphQL) API](https://docs.developers.optimizely.com/digital-experience-platform/v1.4.0-content-graph/docs) to power a website built with the [Astro framework](https://astro.build/) (blog post (or posts) to follow).

Since I was already learning to use Astro, I decided to migrate the blog, so here we are: version 1 (or maybe 0.1?) of the rebuilt [danisaacs.net](https://www.danisaacs.net/). (To be clear, I'm not using Opti CMS on the backend for the blog, because I won't always be able to generate my own licenses.) Still a lot of work to do, but welcome!
